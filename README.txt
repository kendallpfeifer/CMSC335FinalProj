App Description: 
This app is a fun one! It allows you to translate any phrase
to a variety of languages, including Emoji and Mandalorian using
the Fun Translations API. It also allows you to look up all of your 
previous translations by name or email, and to delete them by name or
email, with all translations being stored in our MongoDB. 
Run this project using `node translatorApp.js`
